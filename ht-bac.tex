\subsection{High throughput binding affinity calculator}

(Stefan/Jumana)

HT BAC is a workflow system that uses RADICAL-Cybertools to implement ESMACS protocol, consisting of concurrent multi-stage consecutive MD runs followed by post processing steps. HT BAC uses the EnTK API to express this workflow, which provides the required high-throughput capabilities.

The ESMACS protocol in HT BAC defines a set of stages where each stage contains a single task. The order of stages and description of each stages is identical for each pipeline:

1) Untar configuration files
2) Preprep 
3) Minimize with decreasing restraints
4) Equilibration: NVT simulation at 50K, with restraints
5) Equilibration: NPT simulation at 300K, with decreasing restraints 
6) Equlibratin: NPT at 300k, no constraints
7) Tar


Each task requires the these base arguments which are defined as follows:

* name of task
* path to executable 
* arguments to executable
* number of cores 

We build each stage by appending from task(s) and generate a pipeline by appending from stage(s). 

Include diagram for pipeline ESMACS protocol (EnTK take a pipeline (new unit) to task translation layer in the EnTK box)

How to express ESMACS and how to execute ESMACS

Each stage is a unique task and has a unique argument
Remind the reader of the 7 stages of the ESMACS protocol, and how the stages are expressed, and how the pipelines are added
