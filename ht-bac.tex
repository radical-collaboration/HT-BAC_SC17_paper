\subsection{High throughput binding affinity calculator}

(Stefan/Jumana)

HT-BAC is a workflow system that uses RADICAL-Cybertools to implement ESMACS protocol, consisting of concurrent multi-stage consecutive MD runs followed by post processing steps. HT-BAC uses the EnTK API to express this workflow, which provides the required high-throughput capabilities.
