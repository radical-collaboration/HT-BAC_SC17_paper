Resistance to chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies is a major
factor in limiting the effectiveness of cancer therapies. In many cases,
resistance can be linked to genetic changes in target proteins, either
pre-existing or evolutionarily selected during treatment. Key to overcoming
this challenge is the understanding of the molecular determinants of drug
binding. Using multi-stage pipelines of molecular simulations we can gain
insights into the binding free energy and the residence time of a ligand,
which can inform both stratified and personal treatment regimes and drug
development.

To support the scalable, adaptive and automated calculation of the binding
free energy on high-performance computing resources, we introduce the High-
throughput Binding Affinity Calculator (HTBAC). HTBAC uses a building block
approach to workflow systems in order to provide both workflow flexibility and
performance. We demonstrate close to perfect weak scaling to hundreds of
concurrent multi-stage binding affinity calculation pipelines. This permits
the rapid time-to-solution that is essentially invariant of the calculation
protocol, size of candidate ligands and number of ensemble simulations. As
such, HTBAC advances the state of the art of binding affinity calculations and
protocols.
