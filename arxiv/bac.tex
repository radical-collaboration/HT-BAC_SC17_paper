\subsection{Automated binding affinity calculations}

The implementation of any physically realistic molecular simulation has
always been an involved and multistage process, often requiring the scientist
to overcome a large manual overhead in the construction, preparation, and
execution protocols necessary to complete a set of simulations as well as to
invoke various analysis protocols for determining desired properties
post-production.

Several tools have been been developed to automate MD workflows for the
rapid, accurate and reproducible computation of binding free energies of
small molecules to their target proteins. For example, BAC~\cite{Sadiq2008}
is a partially automated workflow system which comprises (a) model building
(including incorporation of mutations into patient specific protein models),
(b) running ensembles of MD simulations using a range of free energy
techniques and (c) statistical analysis. In Section~\ref{sec:4}, we decribed
how we have enhanced BAC using the RADICAL-Cybertools to produce (HTBAC).
