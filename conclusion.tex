\begin{itemize}
	\item  Importance of Accurate and well bounded time-to-solutions 

	\item  Discuss Weak scaling plot (Result)

	\item  Most binding affinity calculations will use differing protocols that will use the same pipeline (future). Discuss (i) implementation of multiple protocols  (simplicity and extensibilty), (ii) constant TTC.

	\item  New platforms and new methods (including advanced sampling to guide simulations)

\end{itemize}
