\subsection{Automated binding affinity calculations}

% MD is a well established computational methodology for
% studying the time-evolution and conformational dynamics of a diverse array of
% physicochemical systems at the molecular level, from which a whole host of
% physical and chemical properties can be determined~\cite{Karplus2005}.

The implementation of any physically realistic molecular simulation has
always been an involved and multistage process, often requiring the scientist
to overcome a large manual overhead in the construction, preparation, and
execution protocols necessary to complete a set of simulations as well as to
invoke various analysis protocols for determining desired properties
post-production.

Several tools have been been developed to automate MD workflows for the rapid,
accurate and reproducible computation of binding free energies of small
molecules to their target proteins. For example, BAC~\cite{Sadiq2008} is a
partially automated workflow system which comprises a) model building (including
incorporation of mutations into patient specific protein models), b) running
ensembles of MD simulations using a range of free energy techniques and c)
statistical analysis. In Section 5, we decribed how we have enhanced BAC using the RADICAL-Cybertools to produce (HTBAC).

% Two protocols of particular importance for XXXX are ESMACS (enhanced
% sampling of molecular dynamics with approximation of continuum
% solvent)\cite{Wan2017brd4} and TIES (thermodynamic integration with
% enhanced sampling) \cite{Bhati2017}. The former is based on variants of the
% molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) end-point
% method and the latter the `alchemical' thermodynamic integration (TI)
% approach. In both cases ensembles of MD simulations are employed in order
% to perform averaging and to obtain tight control of error bounds in our
% estimates.

% We have demonstrated the lack of reproducibility of single trajectory
% approaches in both HIV-1 protease and MHC systems, with calculations for
% the same protein-ligand combination, with identical initial structure and
% force field, shown to produce binding affinities varying by up to 12 kcal
% mol $^{-1}$ for small ligands (flexible ligands can vary even more).
% \cite{Wan2015, Sadiq2010, Wright2014} Indeed, our work has revealed how
% completely unreliable single simulation based approaches are. While
% accuracy of force fields could be a source of error, we know from our work
% to date \cite{} that the very large fluctuations in trajectory-based
% calculations account for the lionâ€™s share of the variance (hence also
% uncertainty) of the results. Almost all MMPBSA studies in the literature
% use the so-called 1-trajectory method, in which the energies of
% protein-inhibitor complexes, receptor proteins and ligands are extracted
% from the MD trajectories of the complexes alone. ESMACS protocols can
% additionally use separate ligand and receptor trajectories to account for
% adaptation energies. Previous work has produced results in agreement with
% previously published experimental findings \cite{Sadiq2010, Wan2011,
% Wright2014, Bhati2017, Wan2017brd4, Wan2017trk}, and correctly predicted
% the results of experimental studies performed by colleagues in
% collaboration \cite{Bunney2015}.
